## Debugging & Failure Analysis Strategy

This framework is configured to capture rich debugging artifacts to support faster root cause analysis and improve test reliability.
* Screenshot Strategy
* Video Recording
* Trace Viewer Integration

* screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
* video: 'retain-on-failure',
* trace: 'retain-on-failure'

## Test Grouping Strategy (Tag-Based Execution)

This framework uses Playwright tags with --grep filtering to organize and execute test suites efficiently.

### NPM Scripts Configuration

```json
"scripts": {
  "regression": "npx playwright test --grep @regression",
  "sanity": "npx playwright test --grep @sanity",
  "datadriven": "npx playwright test --grep @datadriven"
}
```
 Execution by Test Type
* Run Sanity Suite
 ```bash
npm run sanity
```

Executes all tests tagged with @sanity.

* Run Regression Suite
 ```bash
npm run regression
```

Executes all tests tagged with @regression.

* Run Data-Driven Tests
```bash
npm run datadriven
```
Executes all tests tagged with @datadriven.

## 🔄 CI/CD Ready

This framework can be integrated with:

* GitHub Actions
* Jenkins
* Azure DevOps
* Any CI pipeline supporting Node.js
